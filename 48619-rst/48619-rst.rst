This story deals with the guerrilla aspect
of the Boer War, and shows
how George Ransome is compelled to leave

service with the British.  He is given
the command of a band of scouts
as a reward for gallantry, and with these
he punishes certain rebels for
a piece of rascality, and successfully
attacks Botha's commando.  Thanks
to his knowledge of the veldt he is of signal
service to his country, and
even outwits the redoubtable De Wet.

Hal as a spy.  The hero makes good
his escape from Santiago, and
afterwards fights for America both
on land and at sea.  The story gives a
vivid and at the same time accurate account
of this memorable struggle.

Three girls, with an old governess,
migrate from Kensington to the
West of Ireland.  Belonging as they do
to "the ould family", the girls
are made heartily welcome in the cabins
of the peasantry, where they
learn many weird and curious tales from
the folk-lore of the district.  An
interesting plot runs through the narrative,
but the charm of the story lies
in its happy mingling of Irish humour and pathos.

Clare, the hero of the story, is a boy whose
mother is killed at his side by
the fall of a church during an earthquake.
The kindly clergyman and his
wife, who adopt him, die while he is still
very young, and he is thrown upon
the world a second time.  The narrative
of his wanderings is full of interest
and novelty, the boy's unswerving honesty
and his passion for children and
animals leading him into all sorts of adventures.
He works on a farm, supports a baby in an old deserted
house, finds employment in a menagerie,
becomes a bank clerk, is kidnapped,
and ultimately discovers his father on
board the ship to which he has been conveyed.

In the sphere of fantasy George Mac Donald
has very few equals, and his
rare touch of many aspects of life invariably
gives to his stories a deeper meaning
of the highest value.  His *Princess and Goblin*
exemplifies both gifts.  A
line thread of allegory runs through the
narrative of the adventures of the
young miner, who, amongst other marvellous
experiences, finds his way into
the caverns of the gnomes, and achieves
a final victory over them.

A sequel to *The Princess and the Goblin*,
tracing the history of the young
miner and the princess after the return
of the latter to her father's court, where
more terrible foes have to be encountered
than the grotesque earth-dwellers.

   NEW "GRADUATED" SERIES

.. class:: center small

   *With coloured frontispiece and black-and-white illustrations*

.. vspace:: 2

No child of six or seven should have
any difficulty in reading and
understanding *unaided* the pretty stories
in the 6d. series.  In the
9s. series the language used is slightly
more advanced, but is well within
the capacity of children of seven and upwards,
while the 1s. series is designed
for little folk of somewhat greater attainments.
If the stories are
read *to* and not *by* children, it will be found that the
6s. 9d. and 1s. series
are equally suitable for little folk of all ages.
